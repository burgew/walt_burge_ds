## Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains selections of final projects submitted by Walter Burge upon completion of courses in the Master of Data Science and Information graduate program at UC Berkeley. These projects demonstrate various sets of concepts in Data Science and Machine Learning, as described below.


### Toxic Language Classification
[W207 - Applied Machine Learning](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/207)

[Toxic Language Classification](W207/Toxic_Language.pdf)

This project demostrates the use of NLP techniques for classification, and a performance comparison in this context between four different types of models (LR, NB, XGBoost, NN).


### Field Experimentation
[W241 - Experiments and Causality](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/241)

[PGSS Giving Study](W241/W241_Final_Project_PGSS_Giving_Study_Burge_Vadakkumkoor.pdf)


The PGSS Giving Study was conducted in cooperation with the [Pensylvania Governor's School for the Sciences](http://sciences.pa-gov-schools.org/). This project involved charitable donation campaign design/delivery, data collection and statistical analysis.


### Scalable Streaming Text Analysis
[W251 - Deep Learning in the Cloud and at the Edge](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/251)

[Twitter Sentiment Analysis (slides,](W251/w251_YATSA_slides.pdf)[whitepaper)](W251/w251_YATSA_whitepaper.pdf)


With Twitter as a source of live content, this project explores tools for scalable processing, analysis and summmarization of text data in motion.


### Marketing Performance Analysis
[W261 - Machine Learning at Scale](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/251)

[Scalable Advertising Analysis](W261/README.md)

Used in the context of online advertising, machine learning is a powerful tool for evaluation of marketing campaign efficacy. The "click through rate" (CTR) can be used to measure result of ads and keywords. Logistic Regression can be used to identify "latent features" of data, in this case combinations of ads and keywords that together produce a stronger result than separately.
