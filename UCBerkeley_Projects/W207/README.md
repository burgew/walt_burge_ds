# w207_FinalProject
Graduate course ML project using public kaggle data set


### Final Project Proposal: Toxic Language Classification
#### Team Members: Walt, Yisang, Paul, Joe

#### Description of Kaggle Competition :
[https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge]
In this competition, you're challenged to build a multi-headed model that's capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate. 

#### Proposed Project:

Our team would like to train a multi-headed model using techniques and machine learning algorithms based off of the material covered in class.  While the overall model will involve supervised learning methods, we will also using unsupervised learning methods for feature engineering to see if we can train a model of adequate quality.  

A large effort of our research will explore model interactions with each other (ensemble modeling/stacking) along with seeing if insights can be generated through unsupervised algorithms that can in turn improve the model through feature engineering or selection.  

The Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset is our team's choice based on several factors. 
-	The competition is current and therefore there will be limited shared solutions for this competition in public domain.  The competition is closing within a couple of weeks beyond the course. 
-	While we will submit our final model on the public board, our model will not be submitted for the private leaderboard due to the timeline.  The competition will close March 13. 
-	A text data set and classification metric allows us to leverage what we have learned in this course as well as apply our own domain knowledge of what involves toxic language. 

Our team will evaluate success through use of the training set and the public leaderboard if useable.  The overall objective is to use the Toxic Language data set as a platform for a case study to explore, experiment, and report insights from the overall project.
